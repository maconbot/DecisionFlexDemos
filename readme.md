These demos go hand-in-hand with the DecisionFlex library http://www.tenpn.com/decisionflex.html

They are made open-source under the MIT license so potential purchasers can view the samples first. They will not function standing alone, without the DecisionFlex core library too.

There are three demo scenes here:

- iPerson shows a sims-like character making decisions on what action to take next. The classic application of utility tools.

- WeaponSelection shows a solider pairing potential targets with current weapons, evaluating the position of each target against the strengths of each weapon, before choosing who to shoot with what.

- UFOs shows DecisionFlex working at scale. A large number of small units are spawned from prefabs, and the game timeslices their decision-making power as a group. It also shows DecisionFlex running with no frame-to-frame allocations.
